# Whisper Speaker Identification (WSI)

**Whisper Speaker Identification (WSI)** is a state-of-the-art speaker identification model designed for multilingual scenarios.The WSI model adapts OpenAI's Whisper encoder and fine-tunes it with a projection head with hybrid loss (Online Triplet + Multi-View Self-Supervised). This approach enhances its ability to generate discriminative, language-agnostic speaker embeddings.WSI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multilingual datasets, achieving lower Equal Error Rates (EER) and higher F1 Scores.
